# HappyTaps
Happy hour integration for Slack

This simple backend for a slash command will lookup the top 20 bars near the location provided (defaults to 'NYC') and randomly pick one to print information about.  Users in the slack group can then vote with emojis on whether or not to go to that establishment.  No more arguing about where to go after punching your time card!

Usage:
/happytaps [Location]
